To address the imbalance in your dataset where the "yes"
 attribute has more data than "no," 
 you can use various techniques: oversampling, undersampling, and using class weights:

Oversampling:

Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances
 in the minority class (in this case, "no") to match the number of instances in the majority class ("yes").
One common technique for oversampling is Synthetic
 Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates synthetic
  samples for the minority class based on the existing samples.

Undersampling:

Undersampling involves decreasing the number of
 instances in the majority class to match the number of instances in the minority class.
Random undersampling randomly selects instances from the majority class to remove.

Using Class Weights:

Most machine learning algorithms allow you to assign 
higher weights to the minority class during training to make them more influential in the model's learning process.
For example, in scikit-learn, you can set the
 class_weight parameter to 'balanced' to automatically adjust weights inversely 
 proportional to class frequencies.

from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler

# Define the undersampling strategy
undersample = RandomUnderSampler(sampling_strategy='majority')

# Fit and apply the undersampling strategy
X_resampled, y_resampled = undersample.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)


from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Define the oversampling strategy
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='minority')

# Fit and apply the oversampling strategy
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)


from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Define the classifier with class weights
clf = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced')

# Fit the classifier to the data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)



Breast cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, and heart disease are complex health conditions that require early detection and precise diagnostic tools for effective management. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to improving diagnostic accuracy and prognostic assessment in these diseases.
