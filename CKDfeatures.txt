High blood pressure (hypertension): This is a major risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, affecting their ability to filter waste from the blood.
Albumin: A higher level of albumin in the urine may indicate kidney damage or other conditions.
Sugar (Blood Glucose Random): High levels of sugar in the blood may indicate diabetes or other conditions. Normal fasting blood sugar levels are typically between 70 and 99 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L).
Age: The risk of CKD increases with age, as kidney function naturally declines over time.
